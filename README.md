Drowsiness Detection System

The Drowsiness Detection System aims to develop an automated system that can detect drowsiness in individuals to prevent accidents and improve safety. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyse various features and classify individuals as drowsy or alert based on their physiological or behavioural signals.

Overview:-
1.	OpenCV: OpenCV(Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a widely used computer vision library that provides various functions and algorithms for image and video processing. It offers features like face detection, eye tracking, and facial landmark detection, which are essential for drowsiness detection.
2.	Keras: Keras is a high-level neural networks API written in Python. It runs on top of TensorFlow, allowing for easy and efficient prototyping of deep learning models. Keras provides a user-friendly interface for building and training neural networks for drowsiness detection.
3.	NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides efficient array operations and mathematical functions, which are often used for data pre processing, manipulation, and feature extraction in drowsiness detection.
4.	Pygame: pygame is a Python wrapper for the SDL library, which stands for Simple DirectMedia Layer. SDL provides cross-platform access to your system's underlying multimedia hardware components, such as sound, video, mouse, keyboard, and joystick.
5.	TensorFlow: TensorFlow is a popular open-source deep learning framework that offers a range of tools and resources for building and training neural networks. It provides pre-trained models, such as CNNs and RNNs, which can be fine-tuned or used as feature extractors for drowsiness detection.
6.	Scikit-Learn: Scikit-Learn, also known as sklearn is a python library to implement machine learning models and statistical modelling. Through scikit-learn, we can implement various machine learning models for regression, classification, clustering, and statistical tools for analyzing these models
